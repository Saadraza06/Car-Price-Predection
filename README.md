# 🚗Car-Price-Predection
A machine learning project to estimate car prices based on multiple attributes using regression models.This project develops a regression model to predict the selling price of cars using features like make, model year, mileage, engine power, transmission type, and fuel type. 

# 🔧 Used Tools
• Python 3.x

• Pandas

• NumPy 

• Matplotlib 

• Jupyter Notebook

• Scikit-learn

• Joblib 

# 📊 Insights

• Car age, mileage, and brand are top price predictors.

• Fuel type, transmission, and owner count also impact value.

• Random Forest and XGBoost models give the best accuracy.

• Model aligns well with real-world pricing trends.
