# ðŸš—Car-Price-Predection
A machine learning project to estimate car prices based on multiple attributes using regression models.This project develops a regression model to predict the selling price of cars using features like make, model year, mileage, engine power, transmission type, and fuel type. 

# ðŸ”§ Used Tools
â€¢ Python 3.x

â€¢ Pandas

â€¢ NumPy 

â€¢ Matplotlib 

â€¢ Jupyter Notebook

â€¢ Scikit-learn

â€¢ Joblib 

# ðŸ“Š Insights

â€¢ Car age, mileage, and brand are top price predictors.

â€¢ Fuel type, transmission, and owner count also impact value.

â€¢ Random Forest and XGBoost models give the best accuracy.

â€¢ Model aligns well with real-world pricing trends.
